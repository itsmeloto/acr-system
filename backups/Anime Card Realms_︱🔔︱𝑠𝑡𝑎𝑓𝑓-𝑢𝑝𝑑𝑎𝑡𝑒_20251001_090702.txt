[2025-09-02 10:39:42] PL | Devs: 📢 **Staff Announcement — Striking Staff System**

Hello @Staff Team ,

We are updating how we handle staff actions in **Anime Card Realms**. Please take note of the following changes:

🛡️ **Sapphire Bot – Administration & Staff Strikes**
> - Sapphire will now be used **mainly for administrative purposes**.
> - The **warning system in Sapphire** will be repurposed as a **Strike System for Staff**.
> - Only members with the roles **Ownership Team**, **Lead Team**, and **Management Team** are allowed to use these commands.
> - These strikes are for **staff accountability**, not user moderation.

⚠️ **User Moderation**
> - For moderating users (mutes, kicks, bans, warnings), continue to use **Dyno**, as it supports **modstats**.
> - Do **not** use Sapphire’s strike commands on regular users.

📌 **Summary:**
> - **Sapphire** = Staff Strikes / Administration
> - **Dyno** = User Moderation

Please make sure you follow these guidelines to ensure proper usage and avoid any confusion.

Thank you for your cooperation!  
— *Anime Card Realms Management Team*
