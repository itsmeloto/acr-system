[2025-09-13 21:09:32] Alx: - Fixed lots of the known bugs yall reported this publish, might have missed some tho so let me know ( that includes the quick draws not working towards border achivement, it only works starting now tho )

let us know if some of the new changes came with bugs aswell.
[2025-09-13 21:10:30] Alx: - Battlepass also is now how it was supposed to be, fixed ( it was bugged before, way too easy to complete, its supposed to take a long time to complete )
[2025-09-13 21:13:20] Alx: - infinite tower rewards should now drop and be fixed aswell
[2025-09-13 21:26:16] Alx: @Testers please try to find more bugs, the new fixes could had came with new bugs aswell but I doubt that, check out everything that was already a bug before and let us know if we missed it, also don't only try to clip through walls and stuff, sure it's a bug but not the main thing, your main goal is to find bugs.
[2025-09-14 22:35:57] Alx: @Testers Publishing some changes and bug fixes in 5-15 min
[2025-09-14 22:41:59] Alx: @Testers Published and restarted servers. One of the things that changed is that artifacts are buffed+equipable now, enemies now have recommend rp and their name above aswell, buffed some other stuff aswell, anyway try hard to find new bugs or bugs that may have came with these fixes, if everything is basically fine, release could be either monday/tuesday. ( border chance multi changed from "x" to "%" aswell )
[2025-09-14 22:43:48] Alx: Oh and battlepass should be fixed aswell, please let me know if battlepass still has problems tho
[2025-09-14 22:43:56] Alx: Like claiming more levels than you should and stuff
[2025-09-15 23:41:15] Alx: @Testers Publishing some new changes and a few fixes. ( should be in 2-3 min )

- Added 3 new materials, from first world, 2nd world and 3rd world, it's a new requirement to getting gear, doesn't matter if you already have the gear tho.

- Tags above your head, level, rank ( vip/tester/whaver ) and username, do let me know if they can be scaled better or not.

- New material can be obtained from the npcs ( not castle )
[2025-09-15 23:44:39] Alx: @Testers published new changes! Restarting servers, please let us know if you find bugs with these changes, just find bugs in general.
[2025-09-16 18:06:33] Alx: published some unfinished changes, we currently adding gifting which doesn t work rn so don t use it, i really wanted to test smt quick so yeah
@Testers
[2025-09-16 18:07:02] Alx: ( there are some finished but some aren t to clarify )
[2025-09-18 20:25:50] Alx: @Testers Will do 1 last publish tonight, to test the new card rolling and some other features+ for the wipe and the rewards yall will get ( only the testers that do actually deserve it, the active ones. ) If everything is gonna be fine, then next comes the release of the game, not sure if its tonight, might be early tomorrow if not, we'll see. Will ping one more time when its time for the publish
[2025-09-18 22:58:19] Alx: @Testers Time to wake up, last publish ( hopefully last ) before release is here. Quite a bunch of stuff have been added and changed.

- New card roll animation

- Added so you can craft up to 1000 potions at once if you have the reqs

- Buffed roll speed potions

- Removed the gates and stuff and replaced to portals in the worlds

- Added gamepass, products gifting

- Added walk and idle animations aswell

And more, tbh I forgot but there's more to it, fixed some minor bugs aswell, I want yall to come and test it out, release will be early tomorrow if everything is nice and well, I also need some to afk overnight if possible aswell, using auto roll only ( yes auto roll only, no quick rolling ) .
[2025-09-19 00:27:56] ! Kingnoob: an example for the "and more" is a small animation for everytime you open the skill tree
[2025-09-19 12:37:11] Alx: @Testers Everything is basically ready, I'll start wiping all testers in a bit and the ones who were most active and did work will also receive their tester rewards.
[2025-09-19 18:01:20] Alx: @Testers Rewards will be a gamepass of your choosing, what else would yall like? if yall want a boost in the game I can t really do that besides like a 5k pack or so
[2025-09-19 18:11:04] Alx: its time for tester rewards, @shin @CM | Cataxlyst @JoyBoy @Martialfigter390 @Tangy @Blessed_Gambler @Ltlggg , @Patrick , @Feuerman  for now yall will get the rewards, whoever else I didn't mention and was active  and actually properly testing, let me know please.
[2025-09-19 18:11:27] PL | Devs: @Testers
[2025-09-19 18:26:14] Alx: @Testers ill open game again for testers but do NOT roll and stuff, there is a lil bug thats happening, unless am tripping, has to do with equipping and unequipping a lot
[2025-09-19 18:40:07] Alx: @Testers alr its time for rewards, if you re not in game ( those who i listed let me know ), also if you were active and not mentioned let me know right now
[2025-09-19 18:40:09] Alx: and ill check
[2025-09-19 19:02:32] Alx: @Testers All mentioned testers got their rewards now, except @Patrick as he has all gamepasses, might give him a small in game reward if he wants, anyway as I said if some of u were active and weren t mentioned let me know, being active now doesn't count btw.
[2025-09-19 19:28:42] Alx: @Testers spam equip and unequip
[2025-09-19 19:28:44] Alx: Is it fine now?
[2025-09-19 19:28:53] Alx: I need to know, should be last thing before release.
[2025-09-19 20:18:24] Lotex: @Testers
