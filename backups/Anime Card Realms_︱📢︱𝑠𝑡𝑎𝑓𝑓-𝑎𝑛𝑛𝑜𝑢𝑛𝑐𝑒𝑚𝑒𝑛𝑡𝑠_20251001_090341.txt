[2025-09-26 21:20:37] ! Kingnoob: Just a quick reminder to not ping a lot
[2025-09-26 21:32:11] ! Kingnoob: Also use appropriate pings when pinging like event ping for events and stuff unless it's something big or important
[2025-09-27 08:19:13] Lotex: Higher staff members can just remove the ping roles , + only few staff members can use the mass Staff Role ping
[2025-09-27 08:19:36] Lotex: But ye its better to keep everything professional and organised, without actually annoying people
