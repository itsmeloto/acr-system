[2025-09-20 02:02:39] Alx: @Updates Published some fixes

- Index claim sometimes not working even tho u have the cards ( you'd need an extra card for it to work before, it should be fine now ) was only happening to few people

- Fixed not being able to unequip cards on mobile sometimes 

- Fixed inf battle randomly disappearing sometimes ( let me know if it still happens tho, only happened to like 2 ppl )

- Buffed npc boss stats a little as it's a little too easy to finish the game, if it still is another buff could be coming

- And more

Let us know if the bugs mentioned and stuff are fixed to yall or if more bugs arise with it! I won't shutdown servers yet, I will when i wake up or later.
