W Alx 🔥
[2025-09-07 21:53:00] Alx: @Verified It's almost time for testing, I'm pinging to announce that we'll start picking testers some time tomorrow, don't worry yall will have a big chance to get tester since I'll be picking 50+ testers.

Of course tho, there will be some "rules". When playing you will always have to be on the lookout for bugs, you can even try anything you possibly can in order to bug something, another thing, when finding a bug you'll have to try figure out what caused that bug, since telling me in detail will help us fix them faster. 

It's true that I'll be picking a lot of testers but a disclaimer, not everyone will remain with that role. Only those that actually help find bugs and also explaining how they happened, clips would help more tho. I'll mostly need mobile testers as PC should mostly be fine, but of course you never know. If I missed some details I'll just explain the rest tomorrow, whenever testers are gonna start getting picked.

Also, testers will be picked tomorrow but that doesn't mean testing will also be tomorrow, keep that in mind. It'll be in the next 1-3 days is my guess.
[2025-09-08 18:20:36] Alx: @Verified So it's about time to pick the testers 🎉 , to apply go in #︱🎫︱𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 channel and pick Tester Apps. There won't be any special questions, just say why you wanna be a tester and for how long you could play daily+your timezone, also read the message above. Not sure when tester apps will be closed but they won't be open for long so keep that in mind, they could also close when we feel like we have everyone we need ( no worries we'll pick a lot of people ). When you do get tester you won't be able to play the game right away so just wait for the next announcement where game will be open for testing, should be very very soon.

One more thing, besides finding bugs also let us know about balancing, what we can do to improve it. ( Those who are already tester will keep their roles )
[2025-09-08 18:28:44] ! Kingnoob: also any QoL suggetions ^
[2025-09-09 01:25:19] Alx: By the way I did say there won't be any specific requirements but let me put a requirement right now, you gotta be able to spend atleast 10-14 hours weekly ( minimum ) on the game, of course testing most likely won't last that long but for future testing and stuff, so a minimum of around 2 hours a day, if problems arise and a day you won't be able to be active it's fine just gotta mention in time.
[2025-09-09 11:04:45] Lotex: > And one more thing , we have around *20* more slots for Testers 

> So you still way more then welcome to apply and test yourself 


`Also , a little sneak peek and motivation - the top 3 best (Most active , most helpful and most impacted) testers will get a bonus rewards from me personally `

*That could be robux , nitro or in-game assets and much more *
[2025-09-09 14:07:07] Roland(I miss my wife): @Announcements
[2025-09-09 14:07:19] Roland(I miss my wife): -# use the ping
[2025-09-11 21:54:06] Alx: @Verified @Testers I'm sure yall been wondering when testing is, especially testers. Well I've got news, news are that testing is oficially tomorrow!! Not sure quite yet what time tomorrow as I've got some plans and I'm not sure how it's gonna go but an estimation is in around 21-24 hours from this moment on. Also tester apps are closing very soon, in about 10-12 hours or so, there are still spots so yall can still apply. Also keep in mind there is still a small chance for a delay, but I'm like 90% sure it's gonna be tomorrow as I said, I'll ping once more when it's almost testing time.
[2025-09-11 21:55:04] Lotex: Wish everyone good luck - and lets start something big together !
[2025-09-12 13:22:39] Alx: @Announcements Tester apps are now closed! ( tickets who are still on going won't be closed so it's not over for those yet )

Thank you for those who applied.
[2025-09-13 00:51:04] Alx: @Verified Testing has started around an hour ago, testers already testing, if there aren't many bugs release is very soon, it still probably has a few more days up to even a week though, depends. More sneaks soon tho 👀
[2025-09-17 12:35:13] Alx: @Verified Yall probably wondering when release is, well all the bugs found so far are fixed mostly, we just need to finish one last thing, this last thing can take a little while longer or not, I'm not sure myself, it's something important tho but after were done with it, it's release time basically. Anyway release is 100% this week, could even be today if we manage to do finish it today but don't expect too much, just wanted to let yall know.
[2025-09-19 15:43:47] Alx: @Verified All we gotta do is reset leaderboards ( and then give testers their rewards ) and we can release the game, release should be a bit later tonight, in a few hours, or quicker.
[2025-09-19 19:32:00] Alx: @Verified Everything should be done and it should be ready to release by the looks of it, do keep in mind game CAN still have bugs, game is currently in beta version, so it may still have bugs. Will make game public in the next few minutes!
[2025-09-19 19:51:41] Alx: @Verified Game is now public go play!! https://www.roblox.com/games/76150647486293/Anime-Card-Realms

[2025-09-25 22:07:57] Alx: @Verified Yall probably don't know when the 0.5 update is, well for those who don't know, it should be friday ( tomorrow ), it won't be early friday most likely, probably late friday, to be honest this is almost the size of a normal update, not really a mini update, when it's ready the game will be under maintenance for a little for testers to test some stuff just in case of bad issues. Will be some new content aswell ofc and a few new features, not just QoL only.
[2025-09-25 22:08:18] Alx: Originally wanted to do it thursday but taking a lil longer, I blame that on school tho ngl 😭
[2025-09-26 00:28:34] Alx: Btw the card index, the rainbow reward not being able to be claimed will be fixed on the update don't worry, we do know about it, were sorry for the inconvenience
[2025-09-26 00:52:17] Alx: @Verified Thanks a lot everyone for playing 🙏  We will drop 2 codes instead of 1 for the update that is tomorrow! Perhaps even 3 who knows 👀  I hope yall are enjoying the game, we'll be trying our best to bring good and fairly quick updates! Expect some new content and a bunch of new stuff with the update coming out tomorrow, it's a 0.5 update, not the main update, the main update will have invasions, a new world and much more!
[2025-09-26 18:22:52] Sapphire: 
[2025-09-26 18:25:53] Lotex: @Announcements
[2025-09-26 18:26:36] Lotex: Results will be announced either later today or tomorrow.
[2025-09-26 22:38:03] Alx: @Verified Shutting down servers for update maintenance so testers can test to make sure everything will mostly be fine, maintenance shouldn't take long, can't say an estimate as it completely depends on the bugs. Shutting down within 45 min or so.
[2025-09-26 23:22:36] Alx: Shutting down in 5 mins or so!
[2025-09-26 23:37:05] Alx: @Verified Shutting down servers right now for the maintenance! Will open when everything should be fine and ready! We did quite a lot of things, including a bunch of optimisations to a lot of stuff so hope it won't come with many bugs.
[2025-09-27 00:35:27] Alx: Making the game public for the update very soon

[2025-09-27 01:32:04] Alx: A heads up, next update is the big one guys! This one is mostly a qol and some new features type of update, it took us around 5 days to make tehnically since we didn t start right after game released as we had some bugs and other stuff to fix. I know yall really want higher battle speed so this upcoming update we will add battle speed! Up to 3x battle speed will be in the game on update 1. Invasions are also gonna come this update, biggest thing yet so stay tuned 👀

[2025-09-27 19:24:06] Alx: @Announcements IF this happens to yall, it's not exactly a bug, it's mostly cause roblox is kinda dying currently cause of steal a brainrot, currently having over 25mil players. If it does happen join a private/rejoin, it should fix by itself, ill also check it out to see if i can do something about it. And if more issues randomly start popping up, well its cause of roblox dying mostly.
[2025-09-28 15:55:16] Alx: @Announcements Thank you everyone for playing!! We have now reached over 200 ccu, very happy to see this, I'll also drop one more code on the update for it! For people that are new and don't know what update 1 will have, I'll make a summary.

- Invasions ( biggest thing yet )

- Battle speed up to 3x

- Demon slayer world

- Around 22 new cards!!

That's just a summary, there's more but that's the main things. Some of the cards will also be support related since we only have capsule queen currently. Once again thanks for the support!

[2025-10-01 01:57:42] Alx: Wanted to end the event with some fixes aswell but as the fixes aren't 100% ready we'll just extend it ONCE again till tomorrow or so, doubt yall mind it anyway.
